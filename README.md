# AI-WEB-APP👁️
## 🔍 Overview
The Procrastination Detection WebApp is a full-stack, AI-powered application designed to help users stay focused during study sessions. Leveraging MediaPipe ML, TensorFlow, and Flask, the app intelligently monitors user behavior and alerts them if they exhibit signs of procrastination. With an intuitive React frontend, users can engage with the app in real-time, while the PostgreSQL database ensures data persistence.


* Stay productive with a smart system that knows when you're off track! The WebApp utilizes advanced ML models that detect nuanced full-body gestures, ensuring that only clear signs of procrastination are flagged.

## ⚙️The MediaPipe Holistic ML model captures 543 key points for face, hand, and pose detection.

-Using TensorFlow, the model is trained to detect common procrastination gestures, such as slouching, browsing unrelated content, or looking away from the screen for prolonged periods.

-The Flask backend processes data in real-time, triggering alerts when procrastination behavior is detected.

-The React frontend provides a seamless user interface with visual cues and session reports.

## 🌐 Roadmap and Future Improvements
This project is still very much under active development. Some features I'm hoping to add next:
- Add more advanced gesture recognition patterns to improve detection accuracy.

-Implement a time-tracking dashboard for detailed session insights.

-Introduce a streak tracking system to motivate consistent focus habits.

-Support multi-user accounts for collaborative study environments.
